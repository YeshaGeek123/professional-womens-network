                            <p>PWN (Professional Women’s Network) is an organization designed as an opportunity for women to network with other business women, develop their skills, build new friendships, and stay in touch with what is going on in the professional arena. We host general membership meetings once per month, featuring a keynote speaker. To help fulfill our mission – Strengthening Professions, Developing Networks, Exchanging Knowledge – and honor our tradition – Women Helping Women – we are proud to sponsor scholarships for local area women each year. We also hold various social events throughout the year, in support of the primary purpose outlined above.</p>
